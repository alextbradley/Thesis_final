The research described in this thesis was performed in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford between October 2016 and May 2020, and was supervised by Professor Dominic Vella and Professor Ian J. Hewitt.

This thesis describes my own work, including the experiments described in Chapter 3. I am grateful to Finn Box for his help developing the experimental protocol and prototype experiments on the system. 

The results presented in this thesis are original, apart from the discussion in \S6.6.1 which constitutes review material, and where reference is made to the work of others. No part of the thesis has been submitted previously for a degree of the University or elsewhere.

At the time of writing, one paper based on the work presented in this thesis has been published in Physical Review Letters, co-authored with F. Box, I.J. Hewitt and D. Vella~\citep{Bradley2019PRL}. This paper is based on the mathematical modelling of bendotaxis presented in Chapter 2 and accompanying experiments presented in Chapter 3.
