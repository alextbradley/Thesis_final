I would like to thank my supervisors Ian Hewitt and Dominic Vella for their guidance and support, both academically and personally, throughout my dPhil. Without their patience, generosity and insight, this project would not have been possible.

Thanks also to my peers within OCIAM and Oxford Mathematics. Amongst this special community, I'd like to say special thanks to my office mates, Matt Butler and Michael Coughlan, for helpful suggestions and thoughtful answers to (often stupid) questions; to Finn Box for his patience and assistance with experiments; to the squishy club members for fostering a constructive and non-judgemental environment for discussion and presentation practice; and to Andreas M\"{u}nch, Peter Howell, and Ian Griffiths for their helpful comments on earlier versions of chapters. 

Finally, thanks to my family for their unwavering support and encouragement and to Rebecca Smith, without whom this thesis would not have been possible.
